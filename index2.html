            <h2>Various Perspectives Regarding the Establishment of Religious Truths</h2>
            <br>
                <p>There are three classical approahces to addressing how one can come to confident beliefs in 
            religious truths. These include Fideism, strong rationalism, and critical rationalism.</p>
            <br>
            <section class="fideism">
                <p class='pp'>'Fideism' is the view that religious beliefs are not open to rational valuations 
                and that they should be accepted withot question on the basis of faith. This is a gross
            misrepresentation of the Christianity. A number of issues are at play here: the 
            mischaracterization of religion in general has commonplace in the sense that any religion
            calls for the individual to silence their thinking minds; faith is devoid of reason. This is
            not true. In fact, Christianity has within it a rich history of intellectual giants, many of
            whom had this conversation with both those inside the church and without. Additionally, a
            fault undersanding of the concept of faith has played a role shaping some of the popularly
            held conceptions of what faith is today. The Christian faith is cenetered on an object: a person,
            the person of God in Jesus Christ of Nazareth. Faith in Christianity does not act in a purely
            rational (or as some would say, a non-rational) sense. Faith is an act that is dependant on the 
            character of God. Faith is placed upon, is rested upon, the person of God as one comes to see
            what he is like and what it is he has done in Jesus Christ. To exercise faith is to place the 
            weight of your trust on God Himself. Such an act requires the mind, as such an act has a 
            prerequisite of undersanding: the indiividual must understand God's message, what it means, and 
            what it requires of an individual.</p>

            <br>
            <section>
                <p class='pp'>One of my professors used an example that clearly showed the issues with a fidesitic view
                In an imaginary conversation, a person explained how there was a little green man living
                inside the moon. When someone else questioned him regarding his strange belief, he explained
                that he had no justification for his belief, he simply believed it. He went on to say that his 
                listener should simply believe it too. While this is an extreme example, the point is obvious.
                I have often thought to myself, should I find myself in a situation where I am at a table with
                a Mislim and a Buddhist, how would that conversation go? Ener any two other religious beliefs here
                and ask yourelf, who would be correct, how would their correctness be justified and how is it 
                important that the correct religious view (should there be one) should be held by people? How 
                is it an issue that wrong religious views are held and acted upon? Many people have a quick 
                answer to this one. <figure class='floated'><img src=""></figure> </p>

            <section class="strongrationalism">
                <p class='pp'>On the other side of this spectrum is what is known as 'strong rationalism.' This view holds
                    that faith can be shown as demonstrably true through reason and evidence. In real time, this 
                    equates to the position that 'any reasonable person should be convinced by my aguments.' Many 
                    in the faith held to this view. They thought that through their arguments Christianity could
                    be shown to be absolutely true and that those who did not come to the faith through such means
                    were being irrational. Christians and others have held to strong ratiaonlist views. Many scientists
                    are strong rationalists. Bertrand Russel was a strong rationalist and went on to state that their
                    are no valid arguments for religion; the only motivator for religion is the fear of death. Victor 
                    Stenger, who was a prticle physicist, philosophyer and author held that science disproved the 
                    existence of God. Beyond the fact that proving the nonexistence of something is quite the task,
                    taking such an approach is not as straight forward as one may think. Often, those who hold to a 
                    strong rationalist view inevitably overstate their case. Some may unknowingly become close-minded 
                    as they lose their willingness to readjust according to new data, especially in the sense that 
                    anything outside of the realm of reason cannot speak into this matter. While reason is important, 
                    a human experience that rests solely on reason will be handicapped - throughout our lives there are 
                    many experiences that any in given moment cannot be addressed solely through the faculty or reason.

            <section>
                <p class='pp'>A thrid view is called 'critical rationalism' This view holds that religious claims are 
                    open to rational investigation. It is not necessary to absolutely prove a claim, but it is 
                    important to be able to give good arguments for a claim and defend said claim as being valid 
                    and intelligable. This approach results in one holding a view whose position is justifiable. As 
                    opposed to holding that a view can be irrifutably proven to the point that only someone who 
                    is intellectually deficient would not hold said belief, one can maintain a belief with good reason. 
                    Inductive probability and the explanation of evidence and data come in to play when seeking to 
                    justify a belief in such a manner. We move from absolute certainty to having strong reasons for 
                    holding a belief. In this view, one may reject Christianity while still being rational. A person can 
                    reject a given religious position and do so not as a result of their being irrational. It is possible 
                    that something beyond the rationality is at play, be it a moral issue or a cognitive pathology such 
                    as pride. In short, the critical rationalist approach does not seek to prove in the hardest sense the 
                    truth of Christianity, but they hold to the beleif that arguments can be properly grounded and that 
                    those arguments are sufficient in leading one to a confident belief in the validity of Christianity.

                <p>Some believers hold that apologetics is unbiblical and go further in holding that it removes
                    the need of the Holy Spirit's work in drawing a person to God in Christ.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>For the believer, it can be of great benefit to set aside time to think on why they believe 
                what they believe. There are myriad ways that one may come to a place of decision and faith
                 in Christ. While I am tempted here to address the theological views of Calvinism and Arminiasm,
                  and how they speak to this process, I have dedicated other pages to <a href="calvinism.html">Calvisnsm</a>
                  , <a href="arminianism">arminianism</a> and the practical application of those <a href="cal-arm-compare">

            <h2>A Framework for Approaching Inquiry into God's Existence</h2>
            
        <br>
        <section>
            <h3>Objective Approaches</h3>
                <p class='pp'>Above I addressed the idea of hard proof. In a similar vein, that issue must be kept in mind 
                    when approaching how one determines if God exists. It was often the case in history for people 
                    defending their position to call upon 'proofs' to settle the case. The concept of proof, in the 
                    purest sense, finds its origins in mathematics. The concept of proof addressed those things which 
                    could be shown with certainty; they could be <em>proved</em> by mathematical steps which led 
                    inevitably to a conclusion which would always be the end result; an outcome was proved to be certain, 
                    showing something was true. As an example, if you have one thing and you place it together with another 
                    one thing, you will cerainly always have two things. In logic, certain truths can be established in a
                     similar (albeit still different)
                     <figure class='floated'><img src="img/1+1rescale.png"></figure> 
                    manner. The laws of identity, excluded-middle and non-contradiction are examples of this. Beyond 
                    this, it becomes hard to absolutely prove something to be true. Without getting too deep into <a href="philo-pages/index.html">philosophy</a> 
                    here and addressing what can be known, etc., I will only say that we are left with establihing 
                    conclusions which are reasonable. We can determine what is liklely, what is justifibly believed and 
                    we can act out of those convictions. For those who want to delve a bit deeper into this, you can access 
                    our page on <a href="philo-pages/sci-meth.html">the scientific method</a> here.
                </p>
                <p>An objective approach that can be taken when trying to determine the reasonableness of God's existence
                     can be termed the best explanation approach. This lies behind much of science and is the stance held 
                     by many who hold to a theory of evolution: evolution serves as a framework which best explains the reality 
                     in which we exist. It is important to understand this when trying to have humble and fruitful conversations 
                     with those who hold to another view their you own. The best explanation approach stands on finding the 
                     best explanation among a number of explanations which does a better jobs making sense of the world we live 
                     in when compared to the other explanations. This process takes in all the evidences we have and attempts 
                     to explain all those evidences simultaneously in the most reasonable fashion. The best explanation will, 
                     compared to other explanations, do the best job of satisfying the critera of

                         <p class="def">Explanatory scope addresses the breadth of facts and issues which are addressed. The explanation which 
                             addresses the greater scope of details will be the better explanation overall. If an explanation cannot 
                             speak to the number of details that another explanation can, that explanation is less suited to speak to 
                             reality. The explanation which addresses the most issues is more likely to be true.

                             that border on contrivance. The overall quality of the explanation speaks to an explanation's power.

                             the background knowledge that we already have is going to be the better explanation.

                             suit the situation than to get to the truth. Ad Hoc explanations typically have no general application and are 
                             used in the moment to defend an explanation, often with imagination and creativity, at the expense of prioritzing 
                             the explanation that is actually true. It is more concerned with maintaing a position for the sake of the 
                             position and is less concerned with the a positions relation to what is true. The explanation which is least Ad 
                             Hoc is going to be the explanation that has greater vailidity and grounding in truth.
